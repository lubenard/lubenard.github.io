## Welcome to my website !

Here you will find everything related to my projects !

## First, a word about who i am:

I am IT student currently studying mostly C at [42 Paris](42.fr).

I enjoy everything tech related.

I like coding late at night, especially with [lofi music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f02mOEt11OQ)

I also enjoy coding android apps on my free time. (mostly night).

I am deeply concerned about Open Source.

## Current projects:

I started a open source [digital wellbeing app](https://github.com/lubenard/Digital_wellbeing).
